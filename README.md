Exhibit_LOTSOriginalCode
========================

This is the code and subsequent changes for LOTS based off what Jeff handed to me when I redid the table wiring

It should be noted that for whatever reason the WaveShield only works if the code is uploaded using Arduino 1.0.3. 

There is also a library that needs to be added to your Libraries folder named "WaveHC" which is located at:  
https://code.google.com/p/wavehc/

Please note it will need to be added to your Libraries folder for it to work. Instructions for doing so are available at:
